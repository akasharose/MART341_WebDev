      <p>Jackson really likes pirates.</p>
      <p>I mean, seriously. He REALLY likes pirates.</p>
      <p>Still don’t think it’s clear.</p>
      <p id="large-text">He <span style="color: red">fucking</span> loves pirates.</p>
      <p>His most watched movie? Pirates of the Carribean. His most played games? Pirate games. Favorite board game? Anything involving pirates. He really likes pirates. It’s kind of a problem.</p>
      <p>Connor just moved back in after escaping the cesspool that he called ‘Florida’, and I’ve decided to start a Dungeons and Dragons campaign with him, Jackson, Sam, and Nedward. I only have a few months until Connor leaves for the U of M, and I still don’t have a single fucking clue as to what the living hell my story should be.</p>
      <p>Either way, Jackson just closed on <b><em>9 to 5</b></em>. He was featured ensemble, so it wasn’t too intensive, but whatever. He’s still taking the rest of the summer for himself – trying to recover from the family shit that’s been consuming his life. His Dad had been cheating on his Mom for nearly six years now, and she just found out. As one would imagine, he’s kinda pissed, and could be doing a lot better. So, we were sitting at a Fro-Yo place on Front Street, chowing down on some delicious totally-not-ice-cream treats. I want to help somehow, but Jackson’s not much for talking today – about anything. For someone whose best friend is his own voice, it’s strange to hear him speaking so little. And when he does speak, his voice falls almost half an octave lower in pitch – I can tell he’s low on energy. It pisses me off to all hell to see my friend like this – <em>FUCK</em> his Dad.</p>
      <p>I ask if he wants to watch a movie sometime – I gotta keep him from holing in his room until he starts his Senior year of High School. He shrugs, apathetic. New tactic. How about… dinner? Nope. Catch a show? Urinetown’s about to start playing at Renton Civic – but nope. Eventually, I bring up the DnD campaign. He’s into making a character, but there’s not much to make if I don’t give him a world first. “Fuck” I say. I have to think of something. “Let’s do a pirate campaign.”</p>
      <p>Jackson suddenly bellows with more volume that I’ve heard him use since all this shit started.</p>
      <p>“DUDE”, he roars, “I FUCKING LOVE PIRATES.”</p>
      <p>Everyone in the place stares at him, and I see one Mom cover her kid’s ears. Sorry about that. Jackson relishes the attention for the few moments he has it, and his smile grows back really quickly. You know, it’s the smallest things that make people smile. Like pirates.</p>
