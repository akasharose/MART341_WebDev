This week, for the most part, made a decent amount of sense. The one main issue that arised was trying to figure out how to configure a .css document. Rather than java and html, css happens to not have a heading to the document; once I got that in mind, the entire assignment went fairly simple.

The most fascinating thing is the way art is designed on websites. Rather than planning too much ahead of time, everything's all about trial and error. Try one look, see what works, try it again, rinse and repeat -- it makes github's version feature much more useful, and I feel like I'll need to start using the system more as we continue.

One thing I'm still a little iffy on is the difference between psudeo-elemtents/psudeo-classes and what exactly defines anything as 'psudeo' in css. Other than that, it's just going to be getting the language down; which I think should go fine.
