This week... was a major struggle. I spent nearly every night slowly whittling away at everything, trying to figure out how to get linked videos, coming up with ideas for different pages, and I'm still going to have to come in on Tuesday to finish some of it.

My first major struggle was actually the questionnaire page -- namely that I have no idea what exactly I'm supposed to be doing on that page; I had saved it for last, and when I got to it tonight I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing with it, so just spent time trying to fix the larger problem, and the only significant problem -- my hosted video.

The video I created was fairly short, and exported fairly easily -- but I don't understand the file upload system well enough to effectively create code for multiple versions, and I can't get the .mp4 video to work on any browser or computer. I don't know if I was doing things wrong in the code or if .mp4 isn't as good a format as I had hoped it would be.

On the plus side, as I'm turning the 80% done project in, I'm semi-happy to see that I'm still one of the earlier submissions, which makes me hope that I'm not just a total dolt!

Hopefully. Cause this was really hard.
