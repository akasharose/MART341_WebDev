This week went incredibly smoothly (save the last minute nature of it... it's been quite a week), and I'm starting to grasp the basic concepts.

At first, the list of functions was a little much, so I decided I'd keep a note on my computer listing all the html commands until I managed to learn them more.
After this, I chose a long poem to ensure that I'd have tons of practice going through the motions of line breaks and paragraphs.

One question that did arise as how to create tabs. Though I could technically switch the paragraph to pre-formatted, that would also make the entire thing a bit of a mess layout wise.
I was wondering if there's a command that is equivalent to the 'tab' key in Word or Notepad.

Other than that, this was a fun, straightforward assignment that gave me another chance to read my favorite poem, so thank you for that!

As usual, I don't do much interacting with other students online, so there was no communication there.
