This week was a nightmare. A complete and utter nightmare.

Dropdown menus are the worst. Boxes that are not based on the left side of the screen are the worst. I am bad at .css.

In all honesty, .css is a complete nightmare for me. Something about it just makes getting started incredibly difficult -- where as with html and java, I get started and slowly start creating something, .css demands I already know exactly what's happening ahead of time. Though I usually have general ideas where I'm going, I usually get so lost in trying to make something look an exact way that I never really get a chance to consider artistic choices (artistic is used in a VERY loose sense) as I'm going; it's a lot more stifling, and makes the assignments feel like much more of a checklist than the playful assignments I've been doing up to this point. Though I understand its necessity and basic function, I just really don't like using it.
