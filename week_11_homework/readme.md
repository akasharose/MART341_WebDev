First, I found pictures of walruses. Then, I set up all the code, and ran it, and there were no walruses.

All my text appeared exactly how it was supposed to -- but there were no walruses. I checked and double checked everything, but there were no walruses. It was a bit of a problem, as walruses were kinda the entire idea.

So I went to Michael and said "I cannot find a walrus." He stared at my code for about 20 minutes, than realized that I had messed up and had put 'images/walrus.jpg' instead of '../images/walrus.jpg'. We fixed it, and then there were walruses.

I could technically do much more with styling the text within all the walrus images, but I got everything scrolling and I still haven't started coding my main website, one page of which includes parallax scrolling, so I figured that this should serve.
